# Capstone 2-EPA Fuel Economy
Create a hypothesis based on the provided fuel data and found a correlation betweent CO2 emissions based on the size of the car, and the quality of the fuel used after 15k miles driven.

Utilized 38,000 records from years 1984 to 2017

Split data into sample populations using pivot table filters and confirmed normal distribution using Descriptive Statistics for each sample group by comparing premium fuel vs normal fuel usage.

Built using excel and used Analysis Toolpakâ€™s Two-Sample t-Test Assuming Unequal Variances to compare CO2 emission based on vehicle size and a mileage average of 15,000 miles on the road

The data used for this includes vehicle types, technical specs for fuel Economy and CO2 emissions.
Found a normal distribution for Combined MPG, Annual Fuel Cost, and Tailpipe CO2 emissions based on the descriptives
